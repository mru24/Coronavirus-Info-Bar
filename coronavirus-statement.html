<h2>
  Dear Clients,
</h2>

<p>
  We are all facing challenging times so wanted to let you know that John Hill Associates Ltd are here for you and would like to update you with our plans for the foreseeable future and we hope you agree that they are considered, sensible and practical.
</p>

<h4>
  Keeping people safe
</h4>

<p>
  Our first and foremost priority is to ensure that we continue to follow the governments Covid-19 advice and make all necessary adjustments to working practices to ensure we look after each other and keep people safe and healthy. Nothing is more important to us than this. We have been doing this for some weeks now, and will continue to review any changes on a daily basis and respond accordingly.

  For the small number of our staff who need to attend our office, working practices have been adjusted so they can work safely and at a distance from one another.
 </p>

<p>
  Where our site specific attendance is required as essential by clients, our staff have been fully briefed on how to visit and access client sites in a safe way.
</p>

<h4>
  Continuity of service
</h4>

<p>
  We have made a number of adjustments to our working practices, enabling us to remain fully operational and provide support to you in any way we can. It is very much business as usual.
</p>

<p>
  Our robust IT infrastructure ensures we are equipped to work remotely and seamlessly and we have access to several methods of communications to continue serving you (video conference, telephone conference, skype, zoom, etc.). Whilst we have reduced the level of face to face contact with clients, we are running meetings via these channels. We are talking with clients on a regular basis and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.
</p>

<h4>
  Speak to us
</h4>

<p>
  Naturally we understand clients and residents alike are concerned and worried about this unprecedented situation. Please do contact your consultant or client contact if you have any further questions or you can email us at enquires@j-h-a.co.uk . Please be assured that we will maintain regular contact with you and will of course advise you of any issues should they arise and be likely to impact on our ability to deliver services to you.
</p>

<h4>
  What do we need from you?
</h4>

<p>
  All we ask of you is that the normal flow of work continues and that our invoices ae settled in a timely way â€“ if we have both of these things, we can ensure continuity of service for you.
</p>

<p>
  History has shown that John Hill Associates are immensely resilient and adaptable in challenging times. We remain totally committed to facing this challenge head on and ensuring that whilst keeping everyone safe, we can continue to deliver vital services for you.
